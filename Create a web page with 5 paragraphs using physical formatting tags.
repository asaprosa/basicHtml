    <h1>Text Formatting in HTML</h1>

    <p><b>This is bold text</b> used to highlight important words in a paragraph.</p>
    <p><i>This is italicized text</i> often used for emphasis or technical terms.</p>
    <p><u>This is underlined text</u> which can be used for special headings or hyperlinks.</p>
    <p><strike>This is struck-through text</strike>, usually used to show removed or incorrect content.</p>
    <p><strong>This is strong text</strong> which has the same effect as bold but carries semantic meaning.</p>
